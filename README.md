- 👋 Hi, I’m @marianavadas
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science and learning about the industry. I am curious about coding and programming. I also love to horseback ride and I have my own horse.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science at CU Boulder. I am currently learning how to code in the language C++. I have little experience in coding but I am excited to learn how to code in C++ and eventually in more languages. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different projects that will give me more experience and learning opportunities. I want to learn different things to expand my knowledge. I also just want to meet other people who like coding and be able to connect with other computer enthusiasts.
- 📫 How to reach me through my email mava5928@colorado.edu or through here.
